GraviPy-engine
=======

Tensor Calculus Package for General Relativity
based on SymPy (python library for symbolic mathematics) but ported to SymEngine.



Installation
------------

GraviPy depends on:

* Python (version >=3.6)
* SymEngine (version >=0.7.2)
* JupyterLab (version >=1.1.3, optional)

JupyterLab environment isn't required but it makes it easier to work with complex 
mathematical expressions.

To install GraviPy, simply run

    $ pip install gravipy
